This project aims to implement Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping (RTAB Mapping) using the ZED Mini camera. The implementation will involve integrating April Tag detection, collecting relevant data, conducting qualitative analysis, and finally performing RTAB Mapping. Additionally, an iPhone app will be developed to visualize and interact with the generated maps.

Software Tools used:
● ROS noetic
● PYTHON3
● RVIZ
● RTAB Map
● C++
● OpenCV
● apriltag_ros wrapper
● rtabmap_ros
● zed_ros_wrapper
